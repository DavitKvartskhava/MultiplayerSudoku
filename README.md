We often spend time-solving one game of challenging sudoku together. To reduce the hassle of sharing one puzzle book and to share our love of sudoku with many others, we created a multiplayer version of the sudoku game! Multiplayer Sudoku allows two players to connect over LAN to solve one game of sudoku together, while also competing to fill out more squares. The person who fills out more squares at the end of the game wins, but remember you must work together. If any one input is incorrect, neither player will get to solve the puzzle…

Unity collaborate was used for version control, so I'm uploading the executable version of the game here.

Instructions for running the game on macOS
1. Download MS_vFinal and unzip it.
2. Try opening the file. The following message will pop up: “MS_vFinal can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.”
3. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General
4. At the bottom of the window, you will see a button “open anyway”. Click on that button and enjoy the game.
5. If such a button doesn’t appear follow the instructions below and then repeat steps 3-4
       Locate the path for MS_vFinal.app.
       Then execute the command: chmod a+x <insert path to app here>/MS_vFinal.app/Contents/MacOS/*


NOTE: If you're playing on the same Wifi router, find your IP address with command: ifconfig | grep inet. Or go to System Preferences -> Network -> you should be able to see your IP address.
DO NOT look up your IP address on your browser (that will be your public IP that might be same for all devices connnected to the same wifi).
